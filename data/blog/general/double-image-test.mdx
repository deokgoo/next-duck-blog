# DoubleImage Component Test

## Method 1: Using DoubleImage Component

<DoubleImage 
  src1="/static/images/taiwan-currency-tips/view1.JPG" 
  alt1="First image" 
  src2="/static/images/taiwan-currency-tips/view2.JPG" 
  alt2="Second image" 
/>

## Method 2: Consecutive Two Images in Markdown

![First image](/static/images/taiwan-currency-tips/view3.JPG) ![Second image](/static/images/taiwan-currency-tips/view4.JPG)

## Method 3: Regular Single Image

![Single image](/static/images/taiwan-currency-tips/view5.JPG)
